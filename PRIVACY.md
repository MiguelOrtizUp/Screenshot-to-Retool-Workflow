Privacy Policy: Screenshot to Retool Workflow
Effective Date: January 14, 2026

1. Overview
"Screenshot to Retool Workflow" is designed to help users capture webpage data and send it to their own Retool instance. We prioritize user privacy and follow a "local-first" data approach.

2. Data Collection & Usage
We only collect data when you explicitly initiate a capture (by clicking the extension icon or using a shortcut). This data includes:

- Website Content: A screenshot of the active tab, the page URL, and the page title. This is used solely to provide context to your Retool workflow.
- Authentication Information: Your Retool API Key and Webhook URL. These are required to authenticate and deliver data to your specific account.

3. Data Storage & Security
- Local Storage: All configuration settings (API keys, endpoints) are stored locally on your device using the chrome.storage API.
- No Central Servers: We do not operate any backend servers. Your data never passes through us; it travels directly from your browser to Retool.
- Encryption: All data sent to Retool is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections.

4. Data Sharing
We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties. Data is only transmitted to the Retool endpoint you provide.

5. User Control
You may view or delete your configuration and history at any time through the extension settings. Uninstalling the extension will automatically remove all locally stored data.
